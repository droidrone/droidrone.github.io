    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Waterfall Development</strong><br />
    <p>
      Waterfall development follows a sequential approach, where each phase of the project is completed before moving on to the next. While this methodology provides a clear structure and documentation, it can be less adaptable to changes and may result in higher costs if requirements change significantly during the development process.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Rapid Application Development (RAD)</strong><br />
    <p>
      RAD methodologies emphasize speed and efficiency by focusing on rapid prototyping and user feedback. By involving users in the development process early on, RAD reduces the risk of costly mistakes and ensures that the app meets their specific needs. However, RAD can be less suitable for complex projects that require a high level of customization or integration with other systems.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Ultimately, the choice of app development methodology should align with the project's specific requirements, timeline, and budget.By carefully considering the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology, development teams can select the approach that will optimize the cost-effectiveness of their Android app development project in Bangladesh.
