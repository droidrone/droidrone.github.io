<h3>Limitations</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Limitations%2C%20android%20news&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" alt="Limitations, Android News" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
</center>
<p>
  Android app builders without coding free, while offering accessibility and ease of use, may have certain limitations compared to coded apps developed using traditional programming methods. These limitations primarily relate to design flexibility and advanced functionality.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Design Flexibility:</strong> Coded apps provide greater flexibility in terms of design and layout. Developers have complete control over the app's user interface (UI), allowing them to create custom designs and implement complex animations and interactions. App builders, on the other hand, often rely on pre-built templates and limited customization options, which may restrict the ability to achieve highly customized and unique designs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Advanced Functionality:</strong> Coded apps offer more extensive possibilities for implementing advanced features and functionalities. Developers can leverage programming languages and frameworks to integrate complex algorithms, process large amounts of data, and access device-specific hardware features. App builders, due to their simplified nature, may have limitations in supporting highly specialized or resource-intensive tasks.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It is important to note that these limitations should be considered in the context of the target audience and purpose of the app. For simple apps with basic functionality and a focus on ease of development, app builders can be a suitable choice. However, for complex apps that require extensive customization, advanced features, or high performance, it may be necessary to consider traditional coding methods.
</p>
<h3>Target audience</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Target%20audience%2C%20android%20news&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" alt="Target Audience, Android News" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
</center>
<p>
