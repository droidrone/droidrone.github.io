  The cost of developing an Android app in Bangladesh can vary depending on several factors, such as the app&#39;s complexity, the number of features, and the developer&#39;s experience. However, on average, businesses can expect to pay between $10,000 and $50,000 for a basic to mid-level Android app. For more complex apps, the cost can go up to $100,000 or more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  There are several reasons why businesses choose to develop Android apps in Bangladesh. First, Bangladesh has a large pool of skilled and experienced Android developers. Second, the cost of living in Bangladesh is relatively low, which means that businesses can save money on development costs. Third, the Bangladeshi government is supportive of the IT industry, and there are a number of initiatives in place to help businesses develop and market their Android apps.
